            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              BobTheBuilder is a mobile application designed for use by construction site workers, managers, and related personnel who are clients or employees of BuildSmartr Inc. or its designated partners. The Application allows users, after signing in with a phone number and One-Time Password (OTP) and subsequent session management via secure tokens, to access features across four main tabs: Projects, History, Chat, and Settings. A core function of the Application is to enable users to chat with a bot that is trained on particular project-specific datasets relevant to their work. Users can also update certain personal information such as their name, profile image, and bio.
